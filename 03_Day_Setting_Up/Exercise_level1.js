/* 
Module is exported block code that can be used.

Package is bundle of module.

Module just block of code that responsible one thing only, package in otherhand have multiple responsible it like an application.

NPM is program to manage package easier.

Webpack -> bundleing tool, so all file that makes up the website merge in one file (like rar / zip)

Easier using boilerplate using command npx create-react-app <name-app>

package.json file that control version of package, package-lock/yarn.lock create when we already install package one so it cant be change, .gitignore list of file/folder that we dont want add to git, node_modules all package that has been downloaded, public folder inside have root html file and otherthing that root html need.

Still learning vscode but overall vscode is enough.

Prettier make formating code easier and pretty, ESLint helping indentified what missing or not standard code, snippet also help for write boilerplate code.

We use export <module> -> and import with {}
we use export default <module> -> and import without {} just variable name;
